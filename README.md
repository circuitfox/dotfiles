Dotfiles
========
This repository contains all cross-machine dotfiles that I use. It also
contains configuration utilities and control scripts. The included installation
script will link all the files and clone the Vundle and oh-my-zsh repositories,
if needed.

Installation
------------

```bash
    git clone git://github.com/circuitfox/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ./install.sh
```
